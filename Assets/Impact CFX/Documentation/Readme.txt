Demo packages are available in the 'Impact CFX/Demos' folder.

Move the 'Impact CFX/Gizmos' folder to the root of your assets folder to give special icons to Impact CFX components and assets.

Go to Edit > Project Settings > Impact CFX to define Impact Tags.

Create an Impact CFX Manager in your scene by going to GameObject > Impact CFX > Create Impact CFX Manager. 
You can also right click in the hierarchy and select Impact CFX > Create Impact CFX Manager.

When creating an Impact CFX Manager, you will be prompted if you would like to create an Impact Material Registry asset (if one does not already exist in your project).
You can click 'Yes' to go ahead and create one, or you can click 'No' to manually create one later and assign it to your Impact CFX Manager.

Impact CFX assets can be created by going to Assets > Create > Impact CFX and choosing the desired asset type.

Impact CFX components can be added to objects by going to Add Component > Impact CFX and choosing the desired component type.
